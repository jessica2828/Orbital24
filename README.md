Motivation

During our A Levels, we found ourselves struggling with a lack of motivation, leading us to seek out various tools and methods to make the studying process more engaging. We turned to Pomodoro timer study streams, productivity apps, and idle games to maintain focus. This personal experience sparked the idea to blend the calming and engaging aspects of idle relaxation games, like "Travel Frog," with the effectiveness of productivity apps similar to "Forest." The motivation behind our project is to create a game that not only serves as a therapeutic escape from the stress and hustle of daily life but also makes the process of being productive more enjoyable. We aim to leverage the immersive and creative potential of gaming to foster a sense of community, enhance creativity, and promote effective time management and focus among users.

Aim

Our goal is to develop a mobile app that merges the excitement of adventure games with productivity. We envision creating an immersive world themed around the ocean and the unknown, where users can find respite, express themselves creatively, and connect with others in meaningful ways. By rewarding real-world productivity with in-game progress, such as unlocking new fantasy animal companions and adventure photos, we aim to motivate users to strike a balance between relaxation and productivity. This game seeks to provide a unique platform where engaging game elements and productivity-enhancing features coexist, encouraging players to develop positive habits while enjoying a captivating gaming experience.


User Stories 

As a user seeking motivation and productivity, I want my focus sessions to directly translate into in-game progress, unlocking new adventures and rewards. This gamification helps maintain my productivity by making the process more engaging and rewarding.
As a user looking for a personalised experience, I want to customise my focus sessions with a preferred duration, have the option to lock my phone to minimise distractions, and customise the appearance of my fantasy animal companions and their environment.
As a user dealing with stress, I want to look at cute idle animations which I can enjoy during breaks or idle periods. These less intense games help me relax and destress, providing a peaceful escape from my daily routine.
As a community-minded user, I want to stay connected with friends through the game, receiving notifications about their activities, visiting their virtual environments, and sharing my game progress on social media.
As a user striving to improve my focus and productivity, I want to record details about each focus session, including my mood, a brief description, and a photo from the in-game adventure. This feature allows me to reflect on my habits and accomplishments, track my growth over time, and understand the impact of focused work on my well-being.
As an avid player of adventure/idle games, I want my progress to be automatically saved so I can pick up exactly where I left off in my next focus session. This ensures continuity in my adventure, making the game more convenient and appealing for regular engagement.

Project Scope
Our project, a cross-platform mobile application, aims to combine the excitement of ocean-themed adventure games with productivity features, where users are rewarded currencies, fantasy animal companions and adventure photos for completing focus sessions.

Game Style: A combination of idle relaxation games and productivity apps, featuring calming and engaging gameplay set in an oceanic fantasy world.

Core Gameplay: Users engage in focus sessions represented as adventure sessions for their animal companions. Each session rewards players with in-game progress, such as unlocking new animal companions and adventure photos. The rewards vary based on factors like streaks and session lengths, with certain companions and photos having different rarity levels.

Features (Proposed and Current Progress)
Productivity-Focused Gameplay
[Proposed]: Integrate a Pomodoro timer within the game for focus sessions, where users can choose to lock their phones and enjoy calming music during their session. Each focus session represents an adventure session for the animal companion. Completion of these sessions rewards players with in-game currency, souvenirs, and photos taken during the adventure.
[Progress as of Milestone 1]: Authentication, registration page, login page, focus session page with Pomodoro timer, and focus session gallery page implemented.
Companion and Photo Collection
[Proposed]: Users are rewarded with fantasy animal companions and photos after each focus session. The rewards vary based on factors such as streaks and session lengths. Some companions and photos are rarer and harder to obtain.
[Progress as of Milestone 1]:  Companion gallery and photo reward gallery implemented.
Character and Environment Customization
[Proposed]: Enable customization as a reward for consistent productivity, allowing players to personalise their animal companions and their environments further.
[Progress as of Milestone 1]:  Initial designs and planning phase.
Time-Focused Overview
[Proposed]: Offer a visual representation of the userâ€™s productivity over a specified period, detailing the time spent focused and any breaks taken, helping users track their productivity patterns and make informed decisions to improve their time management skills.
[Progress as of Milestone 1]:  Initial design phase.

Cross-Platform Progress Saving: Allow users to log in with social media to save progress across platforms.

How are we different from similar platforms?
While there are numerous productivity apps and idle games available, our app uniquely combines the engaging elements of adventure games with productivity tools in a way that emphasises both relaxation and focus. Unlike traditional productivity apps that focus solely on task completion, our app:
Integrates Adventure and Productivity: Users' focus sessions directly translate into in-game adventures, making the productivity process more engaging and rewarding.
Personalised Customization: Offers extensive customization options for characters and environments, enhancing user engagement and providing a sense of ownership.
Stress-Relief through Idle Animations: Includes cute idle animations for stress relief during breaks, providing a calming and enjoyable experience.
Community Connectivity: Facilitates social interaction through visiting friendsâ€™ houses and sharing progress on social media, fostering a sense of community.
Comprehensive Tracking: Allows users to record and reflect on their focus sessions, moods, and in-game adventures, helping them understand and improve their productivity patterns over time.
